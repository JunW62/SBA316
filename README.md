# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

You know I am a big fan of The Big Bang Theory. So this project was designed as an interactive web application that allows users to play the extended version of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors by including two additional gestures - Lizard and Spock. The game follows the standard rules where each gesture beats two other gestures, providing a fun twist to the game.

## Features

- **Play Against the Computer**: Users can test their luck and strategy by playing against an automated opponent.
- **Dynamic Scoring System**: Scores are updated in real-time based on game outcomes.
- **Ranking Dystem**: Players' scores are tracked, and rankings are displayed based on their win rate and total games played.
- **User Registration**: Players can enter their names at the beginning of the session, which are then used to track and display scores on a leaderboard.
- **Anonymous Player Option**: For users who prefer not to enter their names, the game offers an anonymous play option. Players who choose not to register could just click the choice button to strat play and are automatically assigned a unique identifier like "Anonym 1", "Anonym 2", etc.
- **Last Winner Tracking**: After each game session, the last winner's name or identifier is saved and displayed when the game is next loaded. This feature adds a competitive edge by reminding players of the benchmark to beat, fostering a continuous competitive environment.
- **Confetti Animation**: Celebratory confetti animations trigger when the player wins a round, enhancing the visual feedback for victories.
